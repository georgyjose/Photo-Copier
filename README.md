# Photo Copier

I've written the code for this software to copy all the image files from my external hard disk.

  - It can recursively traverse through every folder from a given root and find copy all the image files to the specified target folder by preserving the directory structure.
  - Hashing is also implemented in the code to prevent copying of duplicate images.
  - The code can modified easily to copy all the files of required formats.
